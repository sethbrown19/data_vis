## by Seth Alexander Brown


## Dataset

> This data set was provided from Propser. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. This information they use to decide how much money to give borrowers and what their APR will be among many others. We will take a look and to see if we can find out what factors affect a loans outcome status? What affects the borrowers APR or interest rate and other interesting findings as we visually look at this data. 


## Summary of Findings

> We found that the amount of people getting loans in each state is proportional to the states population. The average prosper rating is between 4-6 on a 10 point scale. In general the higher your prosper score the lower your APR. More credit lines open, higher APR. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> We will be looking at what impacts prosper score and how much the prosper score impacts whether you complete a loan and when you complete it. Looking at late payments in the last seen years, credit lines open, credit score among others to see what impacts prosper score. Then taking the prosper score and seeing how prosper score impacts our loan outcome.
